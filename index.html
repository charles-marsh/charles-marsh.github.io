  <h2>Math Tutoring:</h2>
  <p>If you are interested in Math tutoring for Calculus or Precalculus please contact me :)</p>
  <p>In high school I took AP Calculus AB my senior year and failed the first test of the semester. I went on to study very hard and work many hours to get an A in the class, as well as a 5 on the AP test. I believe this is important, because my math tutors were naturally gifted in Calculus, and didn't go through the same struggle that many students have to overcome.</p>
